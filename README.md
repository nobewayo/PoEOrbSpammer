# PoEOrbSpammer
A project to teach myself Autohotkey 2.0  
Probably against ToS, so use at own risk.   
It doesn't read any memory though and the delay between click is randomized.
# Requirements
Autohotkey 2.0  
Game running in 1920x1080 windowed borderless. On your left screen if you have dual monitor.  
Won't work for GeForce Now.
# How to use it:
Add whatever items you need to craft on, into to the middle slot of the currency tab.  
Put in a regex for your desired mod.  
Right click the orb you want to use, hover it over the item.  
Press the End button and put in how many times you want it to apply your orb.

If it succesfully hits your desired affix, it'll make a sound and stop clicking.  
If it runs out of orbs it'll also make a sound and stop trying to click - so put on a YouTube video on your other monitor while you wait.

Press ESC to quit.

# ToDo List
Add a GUI.
